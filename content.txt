Class and Obj (example)
Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure,data type etc)
Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability I
    > debugging
    > easy to colab

End to End Project (ChatBook class)

    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

    > Inheritance
Inheritance code example
inheritance is needed? (code reuseability, parent has access to child class)
gets inherited? - Cmstructor, private attritutes, private —ttDds
constructor Overloading & method Overloading
Super keymrd(can be used Mily inside class, cm rot access variables/attributes, used inside child class)
Types of inheritutce - 1. Single Inheritance | 2. "Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
